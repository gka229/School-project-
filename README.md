# School-project-
/*

There are 2 files called personnel_addresses.txt and personnel_salaries.txt.

Your overall objective will be to perform a manual "join" and "select" of the two files based on the input 
from the user.  "personnel_addresses.txt" contains a name and a town separated by the "|" 
(pipe or vertical bar symbol).  "personnel_salaries.txt" contains a name and a salary with the same separation.

Take input from the user, and output the name and salary of any person whose town matches a substring of the input.
This means if the user inputs "Louis" then that matches Louisville, Louisberg, and StLouis.  If they input "ville" 
then that would match all employees in Shelbyville, Louisville.

Output shall be one person/salary per line separated by ":" (colon).
